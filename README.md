#GridMAT-MD-Auto

Based on Grid-MAT-parallel
A parallel algorithm to calculate area per lipid headgroup (APL) and bilayer thickness in molecular simulations of lipid bilayers
This program is a parallelized version of the orginal GridMAT-MD developed by W. J. Allen, J. A. Lemkul and D. R. Bevan at Virginia Tech. The citation for the original publication is below.
